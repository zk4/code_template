# Blueprint: A Perfect Python Project Structure

Blueprint is an exampel python project you can use to build maintainable applications. The details on the best practices followed in this project are explained in [The Analytics Club](https://www.the-analytics.club)

## Installation

Blueprint uses Poetry for dependency management. If you haven't installed it already please use Poetry's [official docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for instructions.

1. Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button at the top right corner. (If not make sure you change the remote url once you cloned this repository)
2. Clone your new repository to your local computer

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thuwarakeshm/blueprint.git
cd blueprint
```

3.Install project depenencies.

```bash
poetry install
```

4. Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

You are ready to rock.

## Usage

Now you can program your application inside the blueprint directory. The following command will start your application.

```bash
poetry run start
```

The above command will run the `app` function in the `main.py` module. You can import your custom functions and hook it to the `app` function to run them.

If not you can change the entry point to a different function by changing the `blueprint.main:app` configuration in the `pyproject.toml` file.

**To change the main module name**, you can rename the `blueprint` directory. But make sure you also rename the `name` in the `pyproject.toml` file.

**You can add project configuration** straightly to the toml file's `[app]` section. You can read it in anywhere in your project by calling the following lines.

```python
import toml
APP_CONFIG = toml.load("pyproject.toml")["app"]

app_name = APP_CONFIG['APP_NAME']
```

Also you can add app secrets directly to the `.env` file and read it anywhere from your project with the help of Python's built in `os` module.

```python
import os
secret = os.environ['APP_SECRET']
```

This is possible because we've loaded the env file from our `main.py` module. If you are replacing this module, be sure to load it again.
