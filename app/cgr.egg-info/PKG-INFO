Description: # cg
        
        Simple yet powerful code generator.
        Make use of your shell as possiable as cg can.
        
        Pity, the name cg is taken by others. use `cgr` in cmdline. maybe you should `alias cg=coge`
        
        Compare to hygen, yo.
        - yo is way too slow and complicated.
        - hygen pollutes all template files, and only support ejs.
        
        **What I only need:**
        1. [x] template is runable as normal prj. No more \$placehold\$ stuff.
        2. [x] instinct command follows the folder path.
        3. respect .gitignore.
        4. quick project to template and vice versa.
        5. prompt available.
        
        # API design 
        which one you prefer?
        ```
        # no slash
        cg js react oldkey:newkey :newkey2 @:destname 
        
        # with slash
        cg js/react oldkey:newkey :newkey2 @:destname 
        ```
        
        # Scenario
        ## 1
        ``` bash
        cg js react oldkey:newkey :newkey0 :newkey1 @:destname 
        ```
        - copy $CG_TMPLS/js/react to $PWD/destname
        - change all names from oldkey to newkey,  from  CG_ARG__0 to newkey0 ,from  CG_ARG__1 to newkey1
        
        ## 2
        ``` bash
        cg js react
        ```
        - Just copy $CG_TMPLS/js/react to $PWD/app
